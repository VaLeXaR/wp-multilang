Manage translation settings via json.

Add in the root of your theme or plugin file `wpm-config.json`.

Sample configurations can be viewed in config files in folder 'configs' in root the plugin.

Configuration is updated after switching theme, enable or update any plugins.

The plugin has filters for dynamic application configuration for translate.

For turn off translation, set `null` into the desired configuration.
For example, you must turn off translation for a post type `post`.
There are two ways:

1. In json.
    Create in root of a theme or a plugin file `wpm-config.json` with:
    `{
       "post_types": {
         "post": null
       }
     }`

2. Through the filter.
    Add in functions.php
    `add_filter( 'wpm_post_post_config', '__return_null' );`

To enable translation pass an empty array in php `array()` or empty object in json `{}`.

Supports translation multidimensional array of options, meta fields and post_content.
Supports the removal of established localizations.
Supports translation via GET parameter. Add in the GET parameter `lang` code desired language.
Supports clean database of translations when removing the plugin. Translations are only removed from the built-in tables.
Supports import term translations from qTranslate(by Soft79).
Supports automatically redirect to the user's browser language, if he visits for the first time.

Ideal for developers.

For display language switcher in any place add the code to your template `if ( function_exists ( 'wpm_language_switcher' ) ) wpm_language_switcher ();`
Function accepts two parameters:
$type - 'list', 'dropdown', 'select'. Default - 'list'.
$show - 'flag', 'name', 'both'. Default - 'both'.

Or using the shortcode `wpm_lang_switcher`. It accept two not necessary parameters 'type' and 'show'.

Available features for translation:
`wpm_translate_url( $url, $language = '' );` - translate url
`wpm_translate_string( $string, $language = '' );` - translate multilingual string
`wpm_translate_value( $value, $language = '' );` - translate multidimensional array with multilingual strings

Update translation occurs at PHP. Therefore plugin has high adaptability, compatibility and easily integrates with other plugins. This is what distinguishes it among similar.

Available translation html tags by JS for strings what do not have WP filters before output.

Add your tags in config:
`
"admin_html_tags": {
    "admin_screen_id": {
      "attribute": [
        "selector"
      ]
    }
}
`

Where:
`admin_screen_id` - admin screen id.
`attribute` - attribute what need to translate. Available 'text' - for translate text node, 'value' - for translate form values. Or other tag attribute, like 'title', 'alt'.
`selector` - css selector for search needed tag. Each selector is a new array item.

If You need to add translation for multidimentional array for repeated elements You can use custom tag 'wpm_each' for set config to each element in array.
Example, add config for each item 'title' in custom post field array:
`
"post_fields": {
    "custom_field": {
      "wpm_each": {
        "title": {}
      }
    }
}
`

For set translation uses the syntax:
`[:en]Donec vitae orci sed dolor[:de]Cras risus ipsum faucibus ut[:]`

Added shortcode for translate text in any place:
`[wpm_translate][:en]Donec vitae orci sed dolor[:de]Cras risus ipsum faucibus ut[:][wpm_translate]`

If You translate text in established language, add lang parameter:
`[wpm_translate lang="de"][:en]Donec vitae orci sed dolor[:de]Cras risus ipsum faucibus ut[:][wpm_translate]`

Support translating from syntax qTranslate, qTranslate-X, WPGlobus etc.

Compatible with REST-API.
Support transfer the required translation through option `lang` in the GET request to REST.
Has the ability to keep recording the target language through the transmission parameter `lang` in the request.

== Migration from qTranslate-X ==

1. Before installing/uninstalling, make database backup.
2. Deactivate qTranslate-X.
3. Install and activate WP Multilang.
4. Create in root of your theme file ‘wpm-config.json’.
5. Add all needed post types, taxonomies, options, fields to ‘wpm-config.json’. Setting from qTranslate-X not importing.
6. Import term names from qTranslate.
7. Check that everything is okay.
8. If everything is okay, remove qTranslate-X. If not, make screenshots of errors, restore database from backup and add support issue with your screenshots and description of errors.

== Warning ==

Do not support different slug for each language(Yet).

Not compatible with:
- WP Maintenance

== Known issues ==

Function 'get_page_by_title' not working, because in title field are stored titles for all languages. Use function 'wpm_get_page_by_title( $title )' as solution.

NOTE: Because plugins have different ways of storing data, WP Multilang is not compatible with every single plugin out-of-the-box (mostly page builders). This may result in texts not being translatable or translations not being saved. Most of these issues can be resolved using the integration options (wpm-config.json or filters) of WP Multilang.

Please try WP Multilang in a test-environment before activating it on an existing production site and always make a backup before activating!

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/wp-multilang` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Adjust languages on WP Multilang Settings page.

== Upgrade Notice ==

Before installing or uninstalling make the site database backup before.
