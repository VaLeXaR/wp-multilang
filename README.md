Supports configuration via json.   
   
Add in the root of your theme or plugin file `wpm-config.json` settings.
   
Sample configurations can be viewed in a configuration file in a folder configs in the root of the plugin.   
   
Configuration is updated after switching a theme off/on or after update any plugin.   

The plugin has filters for dynamic applying configuration for translate.   

For disabling translation set `null` into the desired configuration.
For example, you should turn off translation for a post type `post`.
There are two ways:   

1. In json.
    Create the root of the subject, or the roots of its plugin file `wpm-config.json` with:
    ```
    {
      "post_types": {
        "post": null
      }
    }
    ```

2. Through the filter.   
    Add in functions.php
    ```php
    add_filter( 'wpm_post_post_config', '__return_null' );
    ```
To enable translation pass an empty array in php `array()` or empty object in json `{}`.   

Supports translation multidimensional array of options, meta fields and post_content.   
Supports the removal of established localizations.   
Supports translation via GET parameter. Add in the GET parameter `lang` code desired language.   
Supports clean database of translations when removing the plugin. Translations are only removed from the built-in tables.   
Supports import term translations from qTranslate(by Soft79).   
Supports automatically redirect to the user's browser language, if he visits for the first time.   
   
Ideal for developers.   
   
For display language switcher in any place add the code to your template `if ( function_exists ( 'wpm_language_switcher' ) ) wpm_language_switcher ();`   
Function accepts two parameters:   
$type - 'list', 'dropdown', 'select'. Default - 'list'.   
$show - 'flag', 'name', 'both'. Default - 'both'.   
   
Or using the shortcode `wpm_lang_switcher`. It accept two not necessary parameters 'type' and 'show'.
   
Available features for translation:   
`wpm_translate_url( $url, $language = '' );` - translate url   
`wpm_translate_string( $string, $language = '' );` - translate multilingual string   
`wpm_translate_value( $value, $language = '' );` - translate multidimensional array with multilingual strings   
   
Update translation occurs at PHP. Therefore plugin has high adaptability, compatibility and easily integrates with other plugins. This is what distinguishes it among similar.   
   
Available translation html tags by JS for strings what do not have WP filters before output.   
   
Add your tags in config:   
```
"admin_html_tags": {
    "admin_screen_id": {
      "attribute": [
        "selector"
      ]
    }
}
```
Where:   
`admin_screen_id` - admin screen id.   
`attribute` - attribute what need to translate. Available 'text' - for translate text node, 'value' - for translate form values. Or other tag attribute, like 'title', 'alt'.   
`selector` - css selector for search needed tag. Each selector is a new array item.   
   
If You need to add translation for multidimentional array for repeated elements You can use custom tag 'wpm_each' for set config to each element in array.
Example, add config for each item 'title' in custom post field array:
```
"post_fields": {
    "custom_field": {
      "wpm_each": {
        "title": {}
      }
    }
}
```

For set translation uses the syntax:   
`[:en]Donec vitae orci sed dolor[:de]Cras risus ipsum faucibus ut[:]`

Added shortcode for translate text in any place:
`[wpm_translate][:en]Donec vitae orci sed dolor[:de]Cras risus ipsum faucibus ut[:][wpm_translate]`

If You translate text in established language, add lang parameter:
`[wpm_translate lang="de"][:en]Donec vitae orci sed dolor[:de]Cras risus ipsum faucibus ut[:][wpm_translate]`

Support translating from syntax qTranslate-X, WPGlobus etc.

Compatible with REST-API.   
Support transfer the required translation through option `lang` in the GET request to REST.   
Has the ability to keep recording the target language through the transmission parameter `lang` in the request.

## Uninstall tips
- If you get 404s after uninstalling the plugin, try to regenerate the permalinks, from the `Settings` admin menu.
